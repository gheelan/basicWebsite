Code Academy HTML/CSS Project

This is a simple website that I created as a project for an Introduction to HTML/CSS course I took on Codecademy.com when I was first learning to code. The task of the project was to take an outline of a design for a website and make it a reality! After completing this project I decided to focus more on learning CS fundamentals and the broader principles of software development which led me away from front-end centered work and towards Java, OO programming, data structures and algorithms, etc. However, I posted this project to highlight my ability to learn new skills, apply them quickly, and to demonstrate a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
